# Random App Idea Generator

Every developer loves a good side project, but they might not always know where to start. Where do you get that spark of inspiration? What should your next challenge be?

The best side projects come from thinking about things you are passionate about. The Random App Idea Generator takes user input to find out what you are passionate about and gives adjective qualifiers to help guide brainstorming and inspire unique ideas!

The Random App Idea Generator uses the free Datamuse API to generate an array of adjectives that are commonly used with the noun the user provides. A random one is selected and displayed on the screen. Clicking generate again gives a new adjective qualifier.
